# Pulsar for Salesforce
Pulsar for Salesforce is a desktop/mobile app developed by Luminix, Inc that allows organizations to sync and work with Salesforce data, all while completely offline.

## Pulsar for Salesforce Features
* Pulsar allows complete sync of your Salesforce data to your mobile device or desktop PC. Work offline, then quickly perform a "catch-up" sync when you get back online.
* Pulsar is NOT a data cache. Your data is stored and encrypted locally in a SQLite database on the device.
* Pulsar is NOT a separate cloud. Your data is stored only in Salesforce cloud and on the device.
* Allows complete Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) of object records, including child and related records, all while completely offline, subject to Salesforce permissions and access controls you are already familiar with.
* Also supports offline access to files and documents, roll-up summary fields, formula fields, validation rules, flows and quick actions, all while completely offline, and subject to Salesforce permissions.
* If you "know" Salesforce, then working with Pulsar as an admin or developer is simply easy!
* Pulsar is available for iOS, Android and Chromebooks, and Windows 10. Download, and start syncing your organization! For premium use, which allows full customization, contact Sales at Luminix, Inc.
* And... you can completely customize the UI by writing HTML/CSS/Javascript apps for embedding in Pulsar, (which is what the remainder of this document is about ;)
